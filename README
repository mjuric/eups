# EUPS : A Unix Product Versioning System

A system similar to [environment modules](http://modules.sourceforge.net)
that allows for simple management of multiple versions of software on a UNIX
machine, as well as their dependencies.

Example usage:
```
source /path/to/eups/bin/setups.sh  # Initialize EUPS
setup lsst_distrib 11.0             # Add the LSST software stack v11 to the path
unsetup lsst_distrib                # Remove the currently set up LSST software stack
```

## Installing

```
./configure --prefix=/path/to/eups --with-eups=/path/to/managed/software/products
make
make install
```
where `/path/to/eups` is the directory where EUPS will be installed, while
`/path/to/managed/software/products` is the path where software managed by
EUPS will be installed. It is recommended that the latter is not a subpath
of the former.

## Manual
Details on using EUPS are given in the manual, `doc/eups.tex`. To produce
a readable copy, cd doc and say:
```
    latex eups.tex; dvips -f eups.dvi > eups.ps
```
or
```
    pdflatex eups.tex
```
**WARNING: The manual is significantly out of date; caveat reader!**
